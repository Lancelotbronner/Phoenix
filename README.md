  <b>Phoenix Game Launcher</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<p align="center">Phoenix is an open-source game launcher for MacOS, created by Shock9616, written in SwiftUI. This launcher was inspired by projects like [Playnite](playnite.link) and [Lutris](lutris.net), and supports any game which can be launched from the command line. (So basically all of them!) It was designed to be small, fast, and not overly complicated. Phoenix is available on GitHub under the [MIT license](License.txt)</p>

## Compatibility

Phoenix is compatible with just about any game that can be run on MacOS as games are launched by running a terminal command in the background. For example, to launch Hollow Knight through Steam, it would run `open steam://run/367520`. This approach means that this launcher can launch games installed through the App Store, Steam (and other similar stores) CrossOver, Parallels, and even emulated games! This makes Phoenix the perfect hub for all the games you have on your Mac

## Usage

To run this launcher, your Mac must be on at least MacOS 13.0 (Ventura). I did my best to make it compatible with Monterey, but with my very limited knowledge of Swift/SwiftUI I wasn't able to make it work without code that only works on MacOS 13. This may change in the future though as the launcher matures so if you aren't able to/haven't upgraded yet, not all hope is lost!

Download the [latest release]() from the releases page. When you open the app, it will look like this:

You can add a game by clicking the '+' button in the toolbar. Fill in as much information as you can. To run the game, you need at the VERY least a name and a launcher command. All the other things are for making the launcher look nicer. (The above screenshot doesn't look very nice does it? üòÖ) Once you've added a game you can delete the placeholder game by right-clicking and selecting 'Delete Game'. You can edit a game you've already added by clicking the gear button on the right hand side of the window. When editing, leave everything at its default value except for the information you intend to change. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE: There is currently a bug that causes the detail view to go blank after editing a game. If you try to edit the game again while it is in this state, the app will crash. To work around it for now (I am working on a fix as we speak), just select a different game and then go back to the one you just edited. Your changes will be shown and you won't have to worry about the crash*

Once you have a game and it's launcher command is configured, you can hit the play button and it will open up!

## Launcher commands:

I know that not everyone has used the terminal before, so here are some templates for some common places to find games:

#### App Store/Regular Mac games:

```
open /Applications/<App Name Here>.app
```

or

```
open ~/Applications/<App Name Here>.app
```

#### Steam games:

```
open steam://run/<steam app id here>
```

You can find your game's id by going to [SteamDB](steamdb.info) and searching for your game. The app id will be in the leftmost column.

#### GOG/Epic Games/Other stores

I don't have any games from these stores, so unfortunately I can't test what commands work for them. If anyone figures out a good template that works, let me know and I will update this section to include it!

#### Parallels

If you didn't know, Applications installed in Parallels have Mac apps that act as launchers in `~/Applications (Parallels)/<VM Name> Applications/`, so any Windows game you play via Parallels can be launched like this (Using my VM called 'Windows 11' as an example):

```
open ~/Applications\ (Parallels)/Windows\ 11\ Applications/<game name>.exe.app
```

#### Crossover

Crossover apps are installed to `~/Applications/CrossOver` so they can be launched like this:

```
open ~/Applications/CrossOver/<game name>.app
```

#### Emulated games:

There isn't a set formula for emulated games, since the games are all run by different apps. That said, most (not all) will work with one of these options:

```
open /path/to/rom/file

For example, this command opens Metroid Prime Hunters in DeSuME for me:

open ~/Documents/Gaming/ROMs/NDS/Metroid\ Prime\ Hunters.nds
```

or 

```
open /Applications/<emulator name here>.app/Contents/MacOS/<emulator name> /path/to/rom/file

For example, this command opens Metroid Dread in Ryujinx for me:

open /Applications/Ryujinx.app/Contents/MacOS/Ryujinx ~/Documents/Gaming/ROMs/Switch/Metroid\ Dread.nsp
```

## Building

If you want to build this app for yourself, just download this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Shock9616/Phoenix.git
```

then open `Phoenix.xcodeproj` in Xcode. You can create a `.app` file by going to `Product > Archive` in the menu bar, clicking `Distribute App`, selecting `Copy App` and then saving the folder somewhere easy to find like your desktop. The app will be inside the folder and you can copy it into your applications folder and begin using it!

For now, if you need to contact me for anything, you can email me at shock9616@gmail.com. If this project really takes off I will make a Discord server and update this section of the readme üôÇ
